## Mini Write-Ups for Each Class

In each paper discussion class, we will cover two papers. All students are required to submit a mini write-up for the two papers before class. 

Each write-up should include:
- A brief summary (a few sentences) for each paper

## In-Class Presentation for 1–3 Classes

Each class will have one student present *Paper 1* listed in the spreadsheet.

Presentation guidelines:
- Approximately 15 minutes
- Cover the paper’s motivation, problem setting, techniques, and experiments
- Lead the discussion of *Paper 2* (no formal presentation needed)

Depending on enrollment, each student will present in **1 to 3 classes**.

## In-Class Participation

Active participation is expected in every class.

Students should:
- Ask questions during presentations
- Discuss the pros and cons of each paper
- Brainstorm potential research ideas related to the papers

## Project Presentation and Final Report

Students will form small groups (maximum of 3 members) to conduct a research project aligned with the seminar topic.

Project deliverables include:
- **Two in-class project progress reports**:
  - **Report 1:** Problem definition and initial motivating experiments
  - **Report 2:** Design of proposed solutions and preliminary results
- **Final in-class presentation:** End-to-end project results
